# Profile-Guided-Software-Prefetching
## Description
APT-GET is a novel profile-guided technique that ensures prefetch timeliness by leveraging dynamic execution time information. In this page, we provide the profile guided software prefetching LLVM pass code for indirect memory access patterns that is designed for APT-GET. You can also find scripts and python codes that you need to run the experiments.
